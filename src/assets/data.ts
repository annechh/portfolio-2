  description: `Hi! My name is Anne-Cathrine Hauge – a 36-year-old front-end developer from a beautiful little place called Naustdal, on the west coast of Norway.

I'm currently finishing a two-year front-end development education at Noroff (vocational level), where I've been working extensively with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and design tools like Figma. I love turning visual ideas into clean, user-friendly websites and interfaces.

What excites me most about this field is the constant learning and creative problem solving. 

My goal is to join a development team where I can grow, contribute, and eventually explore the backend side as well – with the long-term dream of becoming a full-stack developer.

When I'm not coding, you’ll likely find me out in nature – hiking mountain trails, snowboarding in the winter, or paddling on calm waters during summer. I believe a balanced life keeps the creativity flowing.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating – or just want to connect!`,
