  description: `
  Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 
  Iâ€™m Anne-Cathrine Hauge, a 36-year-old front-end developer from Naustdal, Norway.

  Iâ€™m finishing a two-year front-end education at Noroff, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and design tools like Figma. I enjoy turning visual ideas into clean, user-friendly websites.

  What excites me most is constant learning and creative problem-solving. My goal is to join a team where I can grow, contribute, and eventually explore backend development to become a full-stack developer.

  When not coding, youâ€™ll find me hiking, snowboarding, paddling, or relaxing indoors with gaming, movies, or series.

  Feel free to reach out to connect or collaborate!`,
